Supopsed to form a visual staircase. Number, is the number of lines we want to log. 2, 2 lines of steps, 3, 3 lines etc. Otherthing that's extremely important, if we have 1 step chcaracter and 2 total, then 1 space next to it, 2 2 spaces, etc. Number of characters in each line must always be equal. Want to see correct number of empty spaces to the right of the pound.
